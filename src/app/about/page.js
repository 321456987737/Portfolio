              building modern, scalable, and user-friendly applications. From
              the moment I began exploring the world of web development, I have
              been fascinated by how technology can shape experiences, empower
              businesses, and connect people in ways that were unimaginable a
              few decades ago.

          <Section title="My Journey into Web Development">
            <p>
              Every developer has a unique story of how they entered this field.
              For me, it all began with curiosity â€” the curiosity to know how
              websites worked. The first time I opened a browserâ€™s developer
              tools and inspected the structure of a webpage, I was captivated
              by the combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript shaping something
              so interactive.
            </p>
            <p>
              At first, my projects were small: static pages, simple designs,
              and basic interactivity. But I quickly realized that web
              development was not just about making pages look nice â€” it was
              about logic, structure, and problem-solving. I found myself diving
              deeper into JavaScript, learning about DOM manipulation, events,
              and eventually moving toward frameworks and libraries that could
              streamline the process.

          <Section title="Philosophy of Development">
            <p>
              For me, web development is not just about writing code â€” itâ€™s
              about creating experiences. My philosophy revolves around:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
              <li>Simplicity and readability first.</li>
              <li>Performance optimization as a priority.</li>
              <li>Design with empathy for the end-user.</li>
              <li>Continuous learning to stay ahead.</li>
              <li>
                A balance between creativity (UI/UX) and logical functionality.
              </li>
            </ul>

          <Section title="Projects & Experience">
            <p>
              Some highlights of my professional journey include building an
              E-commerce website inspired by Shooz.pk, a full-featured Medium
              clone, and a professional blog platform. Each of these projects
              helped me master authentication, pagination, state management,
              infinite scroll, blog search with debouncing, and professional UI
              components.

          <Section title="Personal Life & Interests">
            <p>
              Outside of coding, I am passionate about history, philosophy, and
              podcasts. These interests fuel my curiosity, creativity, and even
              the way I approach problem-solving in development. I also enjoy
              experimenting with unique UI design trends, such as fluid glass
              effects, preloaders, and interactive carousels.

          <Section title="Vision for the Future">
            <p>
              My vision is to grow as a professional full-stack developer who
              contributes through projects, open-source collaboration, and
              mentorship. I aim to work on applications that impact thousands of
              users, while balancing creativity with logic in everything I
              create.

          <Section title="Closing Statement">
            <p>
              Becoming a full-stack developer has been more than a career choice
              â€” it has been a journey of persistence, creativity, and growth. I
              am excited about the future, eager to keep learning, and
              determined to contribute to the ever-evolving world of technology.
